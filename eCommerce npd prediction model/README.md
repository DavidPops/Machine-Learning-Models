# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project

The Capstone is based on a competition/challenge on Zindi titled "Xente Purchase Prediction" which can be found at the below link:
https://zindi.africa/hackathons/umojahack-2-xente-purchase-prediction-challenge/data

The link leads to the competition page which has the training and testing data sets. But they are also included in this zipped directory for convenience.

All libraries used are open source libraries and include numpy, pandas, matplotlib and catboost.

The `Project.ipynb` file is the project file, with sections annotated. The report and proposal are also attached.
